# Key-Finder
 A simple game with a level editor. The goal is to find the key and escape to the next level
 
** The level editor is not user-friendly. Dialogs are hard-coded but a quick look in the code
 will allow for customization. **


 NOTE: This game was created in eclipse utilizing Java 9 for a school project. Many coding practices
utilized within this project are discouraged.
